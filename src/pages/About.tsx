                        This project provides an easy way to create and enjoy a peaceful environment with background noise and ambient
                        sounds, all from a single browser tab. It's designed to help you focus, relax, sleep better, or enhance music,
                        allowing you to mix and adjust sounds to fit your mood and needs.

                        I created this project because I enjoy working with white/brown noise and calm ambient sounds in the background
                        more than music. It helps me to stay focused and productive, and I‚Äôve found it to be an important part of my workflow.
                        So my goal was to make this experience as simple, customizable, and accessible as possible‚Äîfor myself and for anyone
                        else who might find it interesting or helpful üçÄ
